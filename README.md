# BubbleSortCSV
Sorts and organizes a column of data from one or more CSV files (can also graph it). Possibly useful for research.

This is a test done in about an hour in python regarding sorting data from CSV files using the bubble-sorting algorithm. Within this program, numerical data is
sorted from lowest to highest, with data being able to be pulled from as many CSV files as necessary. Possible implementations to be added in the future include
a visual GUI for importing files at bulk and making the process a little bit more streamlined and user-friendly. The basic structure is primarily designed for
research, as the graphing function now allows users to see the frequency at which a specific number shows up.
